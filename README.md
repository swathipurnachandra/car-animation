# WebVR Car Animation using A-Frame, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## What I Built

- A detailed 3D car model made from *primitive shapes* (a-box, a-cylinder, etc.)
- Custom *keyboard controls* to move the car forward, reverse, and steer left/right ( WASD Keys)
- An interactive environment using a-environment (forest preset)
- A base scene styled to look like a natural VR driving space
- Experimentation with *physics library* such as static and dynamic bodies

## What I Learned

- Basics of A-Frame
- Entity-based 3D modeling using HTML
- Custom component creation with JavaScript and CSS
- Real-time animation and movement logic in VR scenes
